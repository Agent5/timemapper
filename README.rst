Hypernotes
==========

Note-taking on steroids.

A cross of a notebook and an encyclopaedia.

Create notes about places, people, events and string them together into
'threads' at the click of a button.

Automatically visualize temporally and spatially, search by any attribute,
automatically import Wikipedia articles and much more ...

Background
==========

First version was Microfacts / Weaving History <http://weavinghistory.org>
